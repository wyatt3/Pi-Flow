# Pi Flow - A DIY Wifi-Controlled Sprinkler Timer
Pi Flow is designed to be a simple, cost effective, wifi-enabled, sprinkler controller.

It allows for manual and automatic, schedule-based valve control, with the goal of adding weather monitoring and seasonal schedules in the future.

Depending on what related hardware you already have (sprinkler valves, valve power supply, wire to connect from valves to controller), this project can be had for around $25 or less

## Software
- Node.js and Express (back-end)
- Vue 3 and Vite (front-end)

## Hardware
* A minimum of a Raspberry Pi Zero W (with a few small caveats during setup). [AdaFruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3400) has them for a pretty reasonable price ($15 as of November 2025).
    * A Micro SD Card (8 GB is plenty).
    * Micro USB Cable and 5V Power Adapter.
* Any Relay Board (ideally one with optocoupling). You can find these on [AliExpress](https://aliexpress.com) or [DigiKey](https://digikey.com) for a few dollars.
* Jumper Wires (to connect the Pi and Relay Board). Again, you can find these on [AliExpress](https://aliexpress.com) or [DigiKey](https://digikey.com) for a few dollars.
