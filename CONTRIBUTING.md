# How to Contribute

## 1. Reporting Issues
If you find a bug, inconsistency, or have a feature request:

1. Check the issue tracker to avoid duplicates.
2. Open a new issue and provide:
   * A clear description
   * Steps to reproduce (if applicable)
   * Expected behavior
   * Screenshots or logs (optional)
   * Environment info: OS, Node.js version, etc.

The more detail you provide, the easier it is to address!

## 2. Submitting Pull Requests

### Before You Start

* Discuss major changes before implementing—they may already be planned or may conflict with roadmap items.

### Workflow
1. **Fork** the repository.
2. Create a new branch: 
`git checkout -b feature/my-feature-name`
3. Make your changes.
4. Commit with a clear message:
`git commit -m "Add: description of the change"`
5. Push to your fork:
`git push origin {branch-name}`
6. Open a Pull Request to the with a clear description of the changes.
7. I will review the PR and merge (if appropriate) as soon as I can!

### PR Requirements
* Follow the project's coding style.
* Document new features in the README if needed.
* Keep PRs focused; avoid mixing unrelated changes.
